**Date:** 2025-12-04
**Analyst:** Markus (CEO)
**Source Documents:** 1 (Flowchart image)
**Completeness Score:** 40%

---

## Summary

The source documentation provides a good visual overview of the process timeline and communication touchpoints, but lacks detailed operational information needed for comprehensive process documentation.

---

## Well Documented

| Element | Details | Confidence |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Process Flow | 18 steps clearly sequenced from Day 1 to Day 180 | HIGH (85%) |
| Timeline Structure | Two phases: Activation (Day 1-5), Continuous Communication (Day 7-180) | HIGH (90%) |
| Communication Channels | SMS, Email, Phone, Video, Social Media identified | HIGH (85%) |
| Process Steps to Systems | Clear mapping of which channels used at each stage | HIGH (80%) |

---

## Partially Documented

| Element | What's Present | What's Missing |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Process Purpose | "Continue communications with new customers" | Detailed business objectives, success criteria |
| Systems | 5 systems identified by function | System names, vendors, integration details |
| Roles | Bank Manager, Call Centre, Branch staff implied | RACI matrix, specific responsibilities |
| Step Sequence | Order and timing clear | Detailed step descriptions, inputs/outputs |

---

## Missing or Unclear

| Category | Gap Description | Priority |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Process Metadata** | Business unit, process owner, trigger event | HIGH |
| **Pain Points** | No challenges or issues documented | HIGH |
| **Controls** | No compliance or control requirements identified | HIGH |
| **Regulatory Requirements** | KYC/AML for corporate onboarding not mentioned | HIGH |
| **Volume/Frequency** | Number of onboardings per period unknown | MEDIUM |
| **Step Rationale** | "Why" behind each step not documented | MEDIUM |
| **Inputs/Outputs** | Data requirements at each step unknown | MEDIUM |
| **Handoffs** | Who passes to whom not clear | MEDIUM |
| **SLAs/Timing** | Expected completion times not specified | LOW |
| **Exceptions** | What happens when steps fail not documented | HIGH |

---

## Needs SME Clarification

1. **Corporate vs Retail**: Is this process specific to corporate clients or adapted from retail?
2. **Day 14 Email**: Referenced at Day 5 - is this scheduled for future or sent at Day 5?
3. **Activation Notifications**: What triggers Day 30/45 notifications - time or customer action?
4. **End State**: What defines successful onboarding completion at Day 180?
5. **Pre-approved Offer**: What offers? Who approves? What criteria?

---

## Conflicts to Resolve

*No conflicts identified (single source document)*

---

## Recommended Next Steps

Given the **40% completeness score**, recommend:

1. **Proceed with SME elicitation** - Good foundation of process steps exists
2. **Focus areas for SME sessions:**
   - Process metadata and ownership
   - Pain points and challenges (currently 0 documented)
   - Compliance/control requirements (KYC, AML, GDPR)
   - Exception handling scenarios
   - System integration details
3. **Quick wins**: The 18 process steps provide excellent structure to build upon
