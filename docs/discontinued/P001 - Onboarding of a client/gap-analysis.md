# Gap Analysis: Onboarding of a client

**Process ID:** P001
**Analysis Date:** 2025-12-03
**Source Documents:** 1 document analyzed

---

## Summary

The imported flowchart provides a good high-level view of the customer onboarding timeline and communication touchpoints. However, significant gaps exist in operational details needed for complete process documentation.

**Completeness Score: ~35%**

---

## Well Documented

- Process name and purpose
- High-level process flow (8 steps identified)
- Timeline/phases (Day 1 through Day 180)
- Two main phases: Activation + Continuous Communication
- Communication activities at each stage

---

## Partially Documented

| Area | What's Present | What's Missing |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Process Steps | Step names and timeline | Owners, detailed procedures, inputs/outputs |
| Activities | List of activities per step | Detailed execution instructions |
| Timeline | Day markers | SLAs, response time requirements |

## Missing or Unclear

### Process Metadata
- [ ] Process owner
- [ ] Volume metrics (customers/month)
- [ ] Success criteria / KPIs
- [ ] SLA targets

### Step Details (for all 8 steps)
- [ ] Step owners/performers (who does this?)
- [ ] Detailed procedures (how exactly?)
- [ ] Input requirements
- [ ] Output/deliverables
- [ ] Decision criteria
- [ ] Handoff points

### Pain Points
- [ ] No challenges or issues identified
- [ ] No bottlenecks documented
- [ ] No manual workarounds captured

### Controls & Compliance
- [ ] No regulatory requirements mapped
- [ ] No approval gates identified
- [ ] No compliance checkpoints
- [ ] No audit requirements

### Systems & Tools
- [ ] No systems identified
- [ ] No tools referenced
- [ ] No integrations documented

### Exception Handling
- [ ] What if customer doesn't respond?
- [ ] What if activation fails?
- [ ] Escalation procedures
- [ ] Retry logic

## Needs SME Clarification

1. **Ownership:** Who performs each step? (Call centre? Branch? Digital team?)
2. **Systems:** What systems support SMS, email, calls, campaigns?
3. **Controls:** What compliance requirements apply? (GDPR, consent management?)
4. **Pain Points:** What are the known challenges in this process?
5. **Exceptions:** What happens when customers don't activate?
6. **Metrics:** What are the success KPIs? Current performance?

---

## Recommendation

**Completeness is below 50%** - Recommend proceeding with SME elicitation to fill critical gaps.

Priority areas for elicitation:
1. Step owners and systems (affects downstream IT architecture)
2. Controls and compliance (critical for banking)
3. Pain points (drives transformation opportunities)
4. Exception handling (critical for operational resilience)
