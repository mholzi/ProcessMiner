## Detailed Pain Point Analysis

### PP-01-001: No Client Portal

**Completeness:** 85% | **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH

#### Problem Statement

Clients cannot onboard online and must call ACO (Account/Client Officer) to complete onboarding activities.

#### Narrative Documentation

**Core Problem:**
The bank lacks a client portal for the onboarding process, forcing new clients to contact the ACO (Account/Client Officer) by phone to complete onboarding activities. This creates immediate friction at Day 1 of the customer journey, affecting Sign In (PS-01-001) and Initial Activation Communications (PS-01-002). The dependency on phone-based interaction signals a non-digital-first approach in a market where competitors offer fully digital onboarding.

**Impact & Frequency:**
This affects 100% of new clients across all segments (BizBanking, MidCap, LargeCap). Key impacts include:
- **Client Experience:** Day 1 friction sets negative tone for 180-day relationship
- **Operational:** ACO team faces high call volumes, potential bottlenecks and wait times
- **Competitive:** Market disadvantage vs. fintechs offering <10 minute digital onboarding
- **Strategic:** Missed platform opportunity for upselling, document collection, and engagement throughout the journey

Potential client drop-off/abandonment at this stage is unknown but likely significant.

**Current State & Root Cause:**
Clients must call ACO for tasks that could be self-service. Root cause is unclear — may be legacy process rather than regulatory requirement. Many banks have solved AML/KYC digitally. The existing infrastructure (SMS, email systems) could potentially support a portal; the gap is the self-service interface and identity verification architecture.

#### Structured Data

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Affected Process Steps** | PS-01-001 (Sign In), PS-01-002 (Initial Activation) |
| **Impact Level** | High |
| **Frequency** | 100% of new clients |
| **Root Cause** | Unclear - possibly legacy process, not regulatory requirement |
| **Quantified Impact** | Unknown drop-off rate; ACO bottleneck |
| **Current Workaround** | Clients call ACO to complete onboarding |

#### Improvement Ideas

1. **Client portal with digital KYC** — Enable self-service identity verification
2. **Full 180-day engagement platform** — Extend portal beyond Day 1 onboarding
3. **Self-service document upload and status tracking** — Reduce ACO dependency

#### SME Quotes

> "We don't have a client portal" — Markus (CEO)

#### Open Questions for Further Investigation

- What specific tasks does the ACO perform on these calls?
- Are there regulatory blockers to digital onboarding?
- Is client drop-off/abandonment being tracked?
- Could a portal serve the full 180-day journey, not just Day 1?

#### Multi-Perspective Analysis (Party Mode)

| Perspective | Key Insight |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Customer Experience** | Day 1 friction damages relationship; need drop-off data |
| **Technical** | Infrastructure exists; need identity/security architecture |
| **Compliance** | Verify which ACO tasks are regulatory vs. legacy process |
| **Market** | Competitors offer digital onboarding; strategic disadvantage |
