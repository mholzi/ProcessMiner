      "description": "Clients cannot onboard online and must call ACO",
      "narrative": "The bank lacks a client portal for the onboarding process, forcing new clients to contact the ACO (Account/Client Officer) by phone to complete onboarding activities. This creates immediate friction at Day 1 of the customer journey, affecting Sign In (PS-01-001) and Initial Activation Communications (PS-01-002). The dependency on phone-based interaction signals a non-digital-first approach in a market where competitors offer fully digital onboarding.\n\nThis affects 100% of new clients across all segments (BizBanking, MidCap, LargeCap). Key impacts include: Client Experience (Day 1 friction sets negative tone for 180-day relationship), Operational (ACO team faces high call volumes, potential bottlenecks and wait times), Competitive (Market disadvantage vs. fintechs offering <10 minute digital onboarding), Strategic (Missed platform opportunity for upselling, document collection, and engagement throughout the journey). Potential client drop-off/abandonment at this stage is unknown but likely significant.\n\nClients must call ACO for tasks that could be self-service. Root cause is unclear — may be legacy process rather than regulatory requirement. Many banks have solved AML/KYC digitally. The existing infrastructure (SMS, email systems) could potentially support a portal; the gap is the self-service interface and identity verification architecture.",
