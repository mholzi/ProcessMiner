# Gap Analysis Report

**Process:** SEPA Direct Debit process
**Process ID:** P002
**Date:** 2025-12-03
**Analyst:** ProcessMiner
**Completeness Score:** 42%

## Executive Summary

The imported process chart provides a solid foundation for the process flow (7 steps identified with high confidence), but lacks critical details including ownership, rationale, pain points, and regulatory traceability. Significant SME input will be required to complete the documentation.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with elicitation workflow focusing on gaps identified below.

---

## Well Documented

| Element | Confidence | Source |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Process step sequence (7 steps) | HIGH (88%) | sepa-dd-process-chart.md |
| System identification (3 systems) | HIGH (83%) | sepa-dd-process-chart.md |
| Exception path (mandate rejection) | HIGH (85%) | sepa-dd-process-chart.md |
| Step-to-system cross-references | HIGH | Inferred from source |
| Step-to-control cross-references | HIGH | Inferred from source |

---

## Partially Documented

| Element | What's Present | What's Missing |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Control descriptions | Basic names and types | Detailed procedures, owners, regulations |
| System purposes | High-level function | Integration details, data flows |
| Process trigger | Implied (file receipt) | Explicit trigger definition |

---

## Missing or Unclear

### Critical Gaps (Must Address)

| Gap | Priority | Impact |
|-----|----------|--------|
| Process owner / business unit | HIGH | Accountability unclear |
| Process purpose statement | HIGH | No documented objective |
| Step owners/performers | HIGH | RACI cannot be built |
| Pain points | HIGH | Transformation priorities unknown |
| Regulatory requirement tracing | HIGH | Compliance gaps undetectable |

### Important Gaps (Should Address)

| Gap | Priority | Impact |
|-----|----------|--------|
| Volume and frequency metrics | MEDIUM | Capacity planning impacted |
| Step rationale (why each step) | MEDIUM | Change impact unclear |
| Step inputs and outputs | MEDIUM | Integration specs incomplete |
| Control owners | MEDIUM | Accountability unclear |
| System integration details | MEDIUM | Technical specs incomplete |

---

## Needs SME Clarification

| Question | Related To | Priority |
|----------|------------|----------|
| What are the actual cut-off times for DD submission? | PS-01-004 | HIGH |
| Which R-transaction/return reason codes are handled? | PS-01-007 | MEDIUM |
| What specific rules make a mandate valid or invalid? | PS-01-003, CP-01-002 | HIGH |
| Who performs each step (role/team)? | All steps | HIGH |
| What systems feed into the Client File Interface? | SYS-01-003 | MEDIUM |

## Conflicts to Resolve

*No conflicts identified - single source document*

## Recommended Next Steps

Given **42% completeness**, significant SME input is needed. Recommended approach:

1. **Continue with elicitation workflow** - Use imported data as foundation
2. **Focus elicitation on gaps** - Skip questions where we have high-confidence data
3. **Priority areas for SME session:**
   - Process ownership and purpose
   - Step performers (build RACI)
   - Pain points (critical for transformation)
   - Regulatory requirements (compliance traceability)
