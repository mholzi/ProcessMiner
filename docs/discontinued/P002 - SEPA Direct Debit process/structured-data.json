    "process_purpose": "The SEPA Direct Debit process enables the bank to execute direct debit collections on behalf of corporate clients (creditors) across all SEPA countries. The process ensures timely and compliant processing of bulk direct debit instructions, from file receipt through clearing submission and settlement, while managing mandate validation and handling return transactions.",
    "process_trigger": "The process is triggered when a corporate client (creditor) submits a SEPA Direct Debit collection file through the Client File Interface. The file contains one or more direct debit instructions in pain.008 XML format, requesting collection from debtor accounts on a specified due date.",
    "process_frequency": "The process runs continuously throughout business hours, processing direct debit collection files in real-time as they are received from clients. Files are validated and submitted to clearing based on cut-off times for same-day or next-day settlement cycles.",
    "process_volume": "The process handles very high volumes, processing over 10,000 direct debit transactions per day across all client segments (BizBanking, MidCap, LargeCap). Peak volumes may occur at month-end and during recurring payment cycles."
