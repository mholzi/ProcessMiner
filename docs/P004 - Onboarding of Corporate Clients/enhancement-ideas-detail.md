### EI-OCC-016: Predictive Next-Best-Action

#### Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Enhancement ID** | EI-OCC-016 |
| **Enhancement Name** | Predictive Next-Best-Action |
| **Category** | AI & Automation |
| **Source** | Commonwealth Bank Australia (55M decisions/day); Industry benchmarks |
| **Linked Friction Point** | Reactive communication approach |
| **Linked Pain Point** | PP-OCC-002 (Manual Handoffs) |
| **Impact Level** | High |
| **Complexity** | Medium-High |
| **Est. CES Reduction** | -5 points |
| **Priority** | Must Have |
| **Dependencies** | EI-OCC-006 (Unified CRM), EI-OCC-015 (Personalized Journeys) |
| **Completeness** | 93% |

#### Problem Being Addressed

The current corporate client onboarding communication approach is fundamentally reactive — staff respond to issues rather than anticipating them. There is no early warning system for at-risk clients, and relationship managers lack guidance on what action to take next. This leads to client disengagement going unnoticed until it's too late, and staff spending time on clients who don't need attention while missing those who do.

#### Proposed Solution

Implement predictive analytics with a **three-tier maturity model**:

**Tier 1: Rules-Based Triggers (Quick Win)**
- No engagement after Day 14 email → Flag for proactive call
- Defence sector client in KYC hold > 5 days → Trigger RM outreach
- No product activation by Day 30 → Escalate to branch

**Tier 2: Statistical Propensity Scoring (Medium-Term)**
- Build scoring models based on engagement patterns
- Identify at-risk probability for each client
- Prioritize outreach based on risk scores

**Tier 3: Full ML Real-Time Decisioning (Strategic)**
- Real-time decisioning engine (inspired by CommBank's 55M decisions/day)
- Predictive next-best-action recommendations
- Continuous learning from outcomes

#### Narrative Documentation

The Predictive Next-Best-Action enhancement addresses the fundamentally reactive nature of the current corporate client onboarding communication approach. Rather than waiting for clients to disengage or escalate issues, this capability would enable the bank to identify at-risk clients proactively and trigger timely outreach before problems materialize. The enhancement draws inspiration from Commonwealth Bank Australia's Customer Engagement Engine, which processes 55 million decisions daily, though the implementation should start more pragmatically with rules-based automation as a quick-win foundation.

The technical implementation follows a three-tier maturity model: starting with rules-based triggers using existing data signals (Tier 1), progressing to statistical propensity scoring (Tier 2), and eventually achieving full ML-powered real-time decisioning (Tier 3). Critical dependencies exist with EI-OCC-006 (Unified CRM) for data consolidation across the current siloed systems — Genesys for calls, email platform, and SMS — and EI-OCC-015 (Personalized Journeys) for contextual relevance.

From a client experience perspective, this enhancement targets three critical moments that matter: the KYC silence period (Days 2-5) where client anxiety peaks, the Day 30 activation milestone where clients evaluate whether the relationship is working, and the Day 90-180 communication gap where disengagement risk is highest. Market validation is strong: banks implementing predictive engagement report 25-30% reduction in client churn during onboarding, 40% improvement in cross-sell success, and 20% fewer support inquiries.

#### Expected Benefits

**Client Experience Benefits:**
- Proactive outreach reduces anxiety during critical waiting periods
- Issues addressed before they escalate to complaints
- Clients feel valued through personalized, timely communication
- Prevention of negative experiences before they occur

**Operational Benefits:**
- Staff guided on *what* action to take, not just *who* to contact
- Earlier intervention on at-risk clients
- Better client retention through proactive engagement
- Data-driven decision making replaces gut feel

**Quantified Impact (Industry Benchmarks):**
- Estimated CES reduction: -5 points
- Client churn reduction: 25-30%
- Cross-sell improvement: 40%
- Support inquiry reduction: 20%

#### Implementation Considerations

**Technical Requirements:**
- Data consolidation across Genesys, email platform, SMS (currently siloed)
- Decision engine: Start with CRM rules (Tier 1), progress to Pega/FICO/AWS Personalize
- Event-driven architecture for real-time triggers (Tier 2/3)

**Dependencies:**
- EI-OCC-006 (Unified CRM) — Required for data consolidation
- EI-OCC-015 (Personalized Journeys) — Required for contextual relevance

**Implementation Sequence:**
```
EI-006 (Unified CRM) → EI-015 (Personalized Journeys) → EI-016 (Predictive NBA)
```

**Quick Win Approach:**
Tier 1 rules-based automation can begin immediately using available data signals, delivering value while the larger infrastructure builds.
