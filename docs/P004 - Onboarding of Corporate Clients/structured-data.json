The process ensures new corporate clients receive consistent touchpoints from Day 1 (sign-in) through Day 180, building relationship and driving product activation through multi-channel communications including SMS, email, chat, video content, and personal calls from branch and call centre staff.",
    "trigger": "The process is triggered when a prospective corporate client initiates first contact with an onboarding request, AND that contact is formally registered in the bank's system of record (CRM/case management). Trigger Type: Client-initiated, system-captured. The client's outreach (via phone, email, web form, or branch visit) must be logged to create an auditable starting point. Pre-condition: Prior exposure to marketing channels (website, advertising) that informed the client about corporate banking offerings. The formal registration timestamp marks Day 0 for all SLA and regulatory reporting purposes.",
    "frequency": "Continuous. Onboarding requests are received throughout the day, every business day. The process operates as a steady flow rather than batch processing.",
    "volume": "Very High - 200+ corporate client onboarding requests per month. At this volume, the bank manages hundreds of concurrent 180-day journeys at any given time, with approximately 1,200+ clients active in the onboarding pipeline."

      "narrative": "The absence of a self-service client portal creates a significant operational bottleneck in the corporate client onboarding process. Staff must handle all client inquiries and onboarding initiation requests manually through email, with no automated self-service channel available. This affects the pre-process stage through PS-01-001 (Sign in) and all subsequent communication steps, as clients have no visibility into their onboarding progress and must contact the ACO team for every interaction.\n\nThe quantified impact is substantial: staff spend a minimum of one hour per day reading and responding to emails that could be handled through self-service. This administrative burden directly reduces selling capacity, as relationship managers and sales staff have less time available for revenue-generating activities. At a volume of 200+ corporate client onboarding requests per month, this email overhead compounds significantly across the team.\n\nCurrently, there is no formal workaround in place — staff absorb the email volume as part of their daily workload, accepting reduced sales productivity as an unavoidable cost. Improvement ideas already captured include building a full client portal for self-service initiation and progress tracking, or implementing a web form as a quick-win minimum viable solution.",

Rather than waiting for clients to disengage or escalate issues, this capability would enable the bank to identify at-risk clients proactively and trigger timely outreach before problems materialize. The enhancement draws inspiration from Commonwealth Bank Australia's Customer Engagement Engine, which processes 55 million decisions daily, though the implementation should start more pragmatically with rules-based automation as a quick-win foundation.\n\nThe technical implementation follows a three-tier maturity model: starting with rules-based triggers using existing data signals (Tier 1), progressing to statistical propensity scoring (Tier 2), and eventually achieving full ML-powered real-time decisioning (Tier 3). Critical dependencies exist with EI-OCC-006 (Unified CRM) for data consolidation across the current siloed systems — Genesys for calls, email platform, and SMS — and EI-OCC-015 (Personalized Journeys) for contextual relevance.\n\nFrom a client experience perspective, this enhancement targets three critical moments that matter: the KYC silence period (Days 2-5) where client anxiety peaks, the Day 30 activation milestone where clients evaluate whether the relationship is working, and the Day 90-180 communication gap where disengagement risk is highest. Market validation is strong: banks implementing predictive engagement report 25-30% reduction in client churn during onboarding, 40% improvement in cross-sell success, and 20% fewer support inquiries.",
