**Process:** Onboarding of Corporate Clients (P004)
**Date:** 2025-12-04
**Analyst:** ProcessMiner
**Source Documents:** 1 (customer_onboarding_process_flowchart_for_bank_slide01.jpg)
**Completeness Score:** 32%

## Executive Summary

The imported flowchart provides a good visual overview of the onboarding timeline and communication touchpoints. However, significant gaps exist in operational details, controls, pain points, and system specifics that will require SME input during elicitation.

---

## Well Documented

| Category | Element | Confidence | Source |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|
| Process Steps | 13 sequential steps identified | HIGH | Flowchart |
| Timeline | Day 1 to Day 180 journey mapped | HIGH | Flowchart |
| Phases | Activation + Continuous Communication | HIGH | Flowchart |
| Systems | 6 systems/channels identified | MEDIUM | Flowchart |

**Summary:** The process flow structure and timeline are well captured from the source document.

---

## Partially Documented

| Category | Element | Gap Details | Action Required |
|----------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Process Metadata | Business Owner | "Bank managers" mentioned but no specific owner | Clarify process owner |
| Process Metadata | Purpose | "Continue communications" - needs expansion | Define full business purpose |
| Process Steps | Step Owners | Some roles inferred, not explicit | Confirm step ownership |
| Systems | System Purposes | High-level only | Detail system functions |
| Cross-References | Step-System Mapping | Implicit from flowchart | Formalize relationships |

## Missing or Unclear

### Critical Gaps (Required for Complete Documentation)

| Category | Missing Element | Priority | SME Question |
|----------|-----------------|----------|--------------|
| Process Metadata | Frequency/Volume | HIGH | How many clients onboarded per month? |
| Process Steps | Step Rationale | HIGH | Why is each step necessary? |
| Process Steps | Inputs/Outputs | HIGH | What data enters/exits each step? |
| Pain Points | ALL | HIGH | What challenges exist in this process? |
| Controls | ALL | CRITICAL | What compliance/regulatory controls apply? |
| Controls | Regulatory Requirements | CRITICAL | KYC/AML/GDPR requirements? |
| Systems | Integration Details | MEDIUM | How do systems connect? |
| Cross-References | Control-Step Mapping | HIGH | Which controls apply to which steps? |

### Information Not Found

- No pain points documented in source
- No control points or compliance requirements
- No exception paths or error handling
- No SLA or performance metrics
- No approval gates or decision points
- No data flow details
- No RACI or detailed role responsibilities

---

## Needs SME Clarification

| Item | Question | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| "Text here" placeholders | What content belongs in these areas? | Flowchart has incomplete placeholders |
| Step sequencing | Are steps 2-4 parallel or sequential? | Flowchart shows parallel boxes |
| Branch engagement | What triggers branch engagement vs call centre? | Not clear from flowchart |
| Day 180 endpoint | What happens after Day 180? | Process shows "End" but lifecycle unclear |

---

## Conflicts to Resolve

No conflicts identified (single source document).

---

## Coverage by Documentation Area

| Area | Coverage | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Process Overview | 40% | Partial |
| Process Steps | 60% | Partial |
| Exceptions | 0% | Missing |
| Controls/Compliance | 0% | Missing |
| Systems | 35% | Partial |
| Pain Points | 0% | Missing |
| Organization/Roles | 15% | Minimal |

---

## Recommended Next Steps

Given **32% completeness**, significant SME input is required:

1. **Use elicit-process-knowledge workflow** to fill gaps systematically
2. **Priority focus areas:**
   - Controls and compliance requirements (CRITICAL for banking)
   - Pain points and challenges
   - Step-level details (rationale, inputs/outputs)
   - Exception handling paths
3. **Pre-populated data available:** The 13 process steps and 6 systems will be pre-loaded, reducing SME burden for those areas
