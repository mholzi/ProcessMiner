# Pain Points & Improvement Opportunities: Onboarding of Corporate Clients

**Process ID:** P004
**Document Type:** Pain Point Detail Analysis
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-04
**Related Document:** [AS-IS Process Documentation](./as-is-process-documentation.md)

## Executive Summary

Two significant pain points have been identified in the Corporate Client Onboarding process:

1. **No Client Portal** — Clients cannot self-serve; they must contact the ACO team to initiate onboarding and have no visibility into their progress.
2. **Manual Email Handoffs** — All team handoffs (Marketing → Sales → Call Centre → Branch) are coordinated via email, creating risk of delays and dropped cases.

Both pain points affect every case and have high impact on efficiency and client experience.

## Detailed Pain Point Analysis

### PP-OCC-001: No Client Portal

#### Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pain Point ID** | PP-OCC-001 |
| **Name** | No Client Portal |
| **Category** | Customer Experience / Efficiency |
| **Affected Steps** | Pre-process (initiation) + all communication steps |
| **Frequency** | Every case |
| **Impact Level** | High |
| **Quantified Impact** | Minimum 1 hour/day on email handling; reduced sales capacity |
| **Quick Win** | Partial — web form could be quick win |

#### Narrative Documentation

The absence of a self-service client portal creates a significant operational bottleneck in the corporate client onboarding process. Staff must handle all client inquiries and onboarding initiation requests manually through email, with no automated self-service channel available. This affects the pre-process stage through PS-01-001 (Sign in) and all subsequent communication steps, as clients have no visibility into their onboarding progress and must contact the ACO team for every interaction.

The quantified impact is substantial: staff spend a minimum of one hour per day reading and responding to emails that could be handled through self-service. This administrative burden directly reduces selling capacity, as relationship managers and sales staff have less time available for revenue-generating activities. At a volume of 200+ corporate client onboarding requests per month, this email overhead compounds significantly across the team.

Currently, there is no formal workaround in place — staff absorb the email volume as part of their daily workload, accepting reduced sales productivity as an unavoidable cost. Improvement ideas already captured include building a full client portal for self-service initiation and progress tracking, or implementing a web form as a quick-win minimum viable solution.

#### Problems Caused

- No self-service initiation — clients must contact ACO
- No visibility into onboarding progress for clients
- Staff dependency for status updates
- Potential friction in client acquisition

#### Root Cause Analysis

No digital self-service channel exists for corporate client onboarding. The process was designed around push communications rather than client self-service.

#### Current Workarounds

No formal workaround — staff absorb email volume as daily workload, accepting reduced sales productivity as unavoidable.

#### Improvement Ideas

1. **Build a client portal** — Self-service onboarding initiation and progress tracking
2. **Add a web form (minimum)** — Online form to start the process

#### Transformation Considerations

- Web form is a potential quick win with lower effort
- Full portal requires significant development investment
- Consider phased approach: web form → basic tracking → full portal

### PP-OCC-002: Manual Email Handoffs Between Teams

#### Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pain Point ID** | PP-OCC-002 |
| **Name** | Manual Email Handoffs Between Teams |
| **Category** | Efficiency / Communication |
| **Affected Steps** | PS-01-002, PS-01-005, PS-02-001, PS-02-005 (transition points) |
| **Frequency** | Every case |
| **Impact Level** | High |
| **Quick Win** | No — requires system integration |

#### Problem Description

All handoffs between teams (Marketing → Sales → Call Centre → Branch) are coordinated via email. There is no system-based workflow or automatic task assignment.

#### Problems Caused

- No visibility into handoff status
- Risk of emails being missed or delayed
- No audit trail of who did what and when
- Manual effort to track and coordinate
- Difficult to report on process performance
- Clients may fall through the cracks

#### Root Cause Analysis

No integrated workflow system connects the teams involved in the onboarding journey. Each team operates in silos with email as the coordination mechanism.

#### Improvement Ideas

1. Implement workflow automation with task assignment
2. Use a shared CRM/case management system
3. Automated triggers when client moves to next stage

#### Transformation Considerations

- Requires system integration across multiple teams
- May need CRM implementation or enhancement
- Consider process mining to identify actual handoff patterns
- Training required for new workflow system

### [NEW] PP-OCC-003: KYC "Blind Spot" Period

#### Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pain Point ID** | PP-OCC-003 |
| **Name** | KYC "Blind Spot" Period |
| **Source** | Client Experience Analysis - Step 1 (Journey Mapping) |
| **Discovered** | 2025-12-04 |
| **Category** | Customer Experience |
| **Affected Steps** | Pre-Onboarding (Before Day 1) |
| **Journey Stage** | Pre-Onboarding |
| **Frequency** | Every case |
| **Impact Level** | High |

#### Problem Description

During the 3-5 business day KYC verification period, clients receive zero communication or status updates. They have no visibility into whether their application is being processed, if there are issues, or when to expect a response. This creates anxiety and uncertainty at a critical early stage of the relationship.

#### Problems Caused

- Client anxiety during waiting period
- Unnecessary follow-up calls/emails to check status
- Negative first impression of bank responsiveness
- Risk of client abandonment during silence

#### Cross-Reference

### [NEW] PP-OCC-004: Day 90-180 Communication Gap

#### Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pain Point ID** | PP-OCC-004 |
| **Name** | Day 90-180 Communication Gap |
| **Source** | Client Experience Analysis - Step 1 (Journey Mapping) |
| **Discovered** | 2025-12-04 |
| **Category** | Customer Experience |
| **Affected Steps** | PS-02-006 to PS-02-008 |
| **Journey Stage** | Relationship Building → Established |
| **Frequency** | Every case |
| **Impact Level** | Medium |

#### Problem Description

After the Day 60-90 touchpoints (call centre feedback, social media campaign), the client enters a 90-day silence until the final Day 180 follow-up call. This is the longest gap in the entire 180-day journey. The relationship, carefully built through the first 90 days, is left to go cold. Client emotional state shifts to "Disengaged."

#### Problems Caused

- Relationship momentum lost
- Client feels forgotten
- Day 180 call feels abrupt after silence
- Potential for early attrition or reduced engagement

#### Cross-Reference

See Client-Experience-AS-IS-Analysis.md Section 3 (Friction Point FP-004)

### [NEW] PP-OCC-005: Multi-Channel Complexity

#### Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pain Point ID** | PP-OCC-005 |
| **Name** | Multi-Channel Complexity |
| **Source** | Client Experience Analysis - Step 1 (Journey Mapping) |
| **Discovered** | 2025-12-04 |
| **Category** | Customer Experience / Efficiency |
| **Affected Steps** | All communication steps |
| **Journey Stage** | All Stages |
| **Frequency** | Every case |
| **Impact Level** | Medium |

#### Problem Description

The client is contacted through 6 different channels (SMS, Email, Video, Phone-Branch, Phone-CallCentre, Social Media) by 4 different teams (Marketing, Sales, Call Centre, Branch Staff) with no unified view. This increases client effort as they must track "who said what" across multiple touchpoints. The experience feels like dealing with multiple banks, not one unified institution.

#### Problems Caused

- Client must mentally track communications across channels
- Different teams may not know what others have communicated
- Client unsure which channel/team to use for follow-up
- Increases cognitive load and frustration

#### Cross-Reference

### [NEW] PP-OCC-006: Generic Inbox with No Auto-Responder

#### Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pain Point ID** | PP-OCC-006 |
| **Name** | Generic Inbox with No Auto-Responder |
| **Source** | Client Experience Analysis - Step 2 (Friction Analysis) |
| **Discovered** | 2025-12-04 |
| **Category** | Customer Experience |
| **Affected Steps** | First Contact (Pre-Process) |
| **Journey Stage** | Pre-Onboarding |
| **Frequency** | Every case |
| **Impact Level** | High |

#### Problem Description

Corporate clients' first interaction is sending an email to a generic inbox (not a dedicated corporate onboarding channel). There is no auto-acknowledgment — the client sends their request and receives nothing back until a human responds. Business hours only (9-5). High-value corporate clients are treated the same as general inquiries. The first impression is one of uncertainty: "Did they get my email? Is anyone working on this?"

#### Problems Caused

- No confirmation of receipt
- Uncertainty about whether email was received
- After-hours/weekend emails sit in silence
- Corporate clients not differentiated from general inquiries
- Poor first impression of bank responsiveness

#### Cross-Reference

See Client-Experience-AS-IS-Analysis.md Section 3 (Friction Point FP-006)

### [NEW] PP-OCC-007: No Upfront Document Checklist

#### Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pain Point ID** | PP-OCC-007 |
| **Name** | No Upfront Document Checklist |
| **Source** | Client Experience Analysis - Step 2 (Friction Analysis) |
| **Discovered** | 2025-12-04 |
| **Category** | Customer Experience / Efficiency |
| **Affected Steps** | Pre-Onboarding, KYC |
| **Journey Stage** | Pre-Onboarding |
| **Frequency** | Every case |
| **Impact Level** | High |
| **Quantified Impact** | Average 3 rounds of document requests per client |

#### Problem Description

There is no upfront checklist telling clients exactly what documents they need for KYC. Instead, clients submit what they think is needed, then receive requests for additional documents. On average, this back-and-forth happens 3 times before documentation is complete. Each round adds days to the onboarding timeline and frustration for the client: "Why didn't you tell me this upfront?"

#### Problems Caused

- Multiple rounds of document requests (avg 3)
- Extended onboarding timeline
- Client frustration and effort
- Perception of disorganization
- Increased staff workload processing incomplete submissions

#### Cross-Reference

See Client-Experience-AS-IS-Analysis.md Section 3 (Friction Point FP-007)

### [NEW] PP-OCC-008: No Single Point of Contact

#### Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pain Point ID** | PP-OCC-008 |
| **Name** | No Single Point of Contact |
| **Source** | Client Experience Analysis - Step 2 (Friction Analysis) |
| **Discovered** | 2025-12-04 |
| **Category** | Customer Experience |
| **Affected Steps** | All Steps |
| **Journey Stage** | All Stages |
| **Frequency** | Every case |
| **Impact Level** | High |

#### Problem Description

Throughout the entire 180-day journey, the client has no named contact. When they have questions, issues, or need help, they must email the generic inbox. Different staff may respond each time. The client must re-explain their situation and hope the person reading has context. There is no relationship continuity — the experience is transactional rather than relational.

#### Problems Caused

- No relationship continuity
- Client must re-explain situation each time
- Different staff may give inconsistent responses
- Impersonal experience for high-value corporate clients
- Missed opportunity to build trust and loyalty

#### Cross-Reference

See Client-Experience-AS-IS-Analysis.md Section 3 (Friction Point FP-008)
