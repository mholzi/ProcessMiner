## 1. Introduction

### Compliance Risk Summary

We have **2 high-risk compliance gaps** in a process onboarding Corporate Bank clients with an average annual facility value of €2.5M per client. The two gaps—missing Data Protection Impact Assessment and inadequate Third Party Reliance framework—expose the bank to regulatory findings from both the Data Protection Commission and the Central Bank of Ireland. If audited in the current state, we face near-certain observations and potential enforcement action. This memo identifies the 6 gaps, assesses 16 controls, and proposes 10 remediation actions to strengthen compliance posture within 90 days.

### Background

Client Onboarding is the gateway process through which all new Corporate Bank relationships are established. The process handles sensitive personal and financial data, makes credit decisions, and establishes the ongoing AML monitoring relationship. Regulatory scrutiny of onboarding processes has intensified following high-profile AML enforcement actions across European banks. The Central Bank of Ireland has signaled increased focus on customer due diligence effectiveness in its 2024-2025 inspection priorities.

The process operates under a complex regulatory framework including AMLD 5/6 for anti-money laundering, GDPR for data protection, PSD2 for authentication, and CRD IV/CRR for credit risk management. The upcoming AMLR (2027) and eIDAS 2.0 (2026) will further reshape requirements.

### Purpose of This Document

This management summary synthesizes the compliance and control assessment of the **Client Onboarding** process. It provides executives with a clear view of regulatory exposure, control effectiveness, and remediation priorities.

## 3. Tenets

### Core Principles

1. **Every Control Must Trace to a Requirement**
   No orphaned controls. No uncontrolled requirements. Complete bidirectional traceability.

2. **Control Effectiveness Over Existence**
   Having a control doesn't mean it works. We measure performance, not presence.

3. **Risk-Based Prioritization**
   High-risk processes need stronger controls. Prioritize by exposure, not convenience.

4. **Segregation of Duties Is Sacred**
   Four-eyes principle and maker-checker cannot be eliminated or weakened.

5. **Audit Trail Is Control Evidence**
   Controls without evidence are unverifiable. Document everything.

6. **Regulatory Change Awareness**
   TO-BE state must address emerging regulations, not just current requirements.

### Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale | Impact |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Regulatory mandates | Legal obligation | Controls cannot be removed |
| Audit requirements | External scrutiny | Evidence must be maintained |
| System limitations | T24, Fenergo, CDS architecture | Some automation requires vendor engagement |

## 4. State of the Business

### Compliance Overview

The Client Onboarding process operates with a **solid but not complete** compliance posture. The control framework effectively manages the highest risks—AML and fraud—through well-designed controls supported by purpose-built systems. However, peripheral compliance areas have gaps that require attention before regulatory examination.

The 16 control points achieve an average effectiveness rating of 4.1/5, with 81% rated Effective or Highly Effective. The strong performance is concentrated in automated controls (average 4.7/5) while manual controls lag (average 3.5/5). This pattern is consistent across banking: automation removes human variability and improves consistency.

Three controls are ineffective or only partially effective: Welcome Call Quality (2.2/5), Account Configuration Verification (2.8/5), and Product Disclosure (2.8/5). All three are manual controls that fail under operational pressure. These weaknesses create conduct risk exposure and have been flagged in internal audit.

### Key Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value | Status | Risk Level |
|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| Total Control Points | 16 | Complete | Low |
| Regulatory Controls | 12 | 2 gaps | Medium |
| Internal Controls | 4 | Complete | Low |
| Automated Controls | 4 | High effectiveness | Low |
| Manual Controls | 8 | Variable effectiveness | Medium |
| Overall Effectiveness | 4.1/5 | Above target | Low |

### Regulatory Framework Coverage

## 5. Lessons Learned

### What's Working

**Automated controls are highly effective.** The four fully automated controls (SCA, PEP screening, bureau check, consent capture) all achieve ratings of 4.4 or higher. Automation removes human variability and ensures consistent execution. The investment in Fenergo for KYC case management and World-Check for screening has paid off in compliance effectiveness.

**KYC control cluster is robust.** The combination of Jumio for document verification, World-Check for screening, Fenergo for case management, and clear KYC Analyst accountability creates a well-functioning control environment. The Q3 2024 audit found no material issues with CDD controls.

**Segregation of duties is enforced.** T24 maker-checker controls are system-enforced with no bypass capability. Credit approval limits are hardcoded. EDD escalation to Compliance is documented and followed.

### What's Not Working

**Manual controls fail under operational pressure.** The three weak controls (Welcome Call, Account Configuration, Product Disclosure) are all manual processes that rely on staff completing tasks consistently. When volume spikes or staff are under time pressure, these controls are the first to be skipped or performed superficially.

**Welcome call mechanism doesn't match client behavior.** The welcome call control achieves only 33% first-attempt success. Business clients don't answer unknown numbers. The control objective (verify client understanding) is valid, but the mechanism (phone call) is wrong for modern clients.

**Evidence capture is inconsistent for manual controls.** Automated controls produce complete, timestamped logs. Manual controls depend on staff completing checklists and entering notes—evidence quality varies significantly by individual.

### Root Cause Analysis

| Control Issue | Root Cause | Evidence | Risk Implication |
|---------------|------------|----------|------------------|
| Welcome call 33% completion | Phone-only mechanism doesn't match client behavior | CRM call logs | Disclosure requirement may not be verifiably met |
| Configuration verification gaps | Manual checklist without system enforcement | Missing checklist entries | Account errors may reach clients |
| World-Check 40% false positives | Screening rules not optimized for client profile | World-Check analytics | KYC analyst time wasted on clearances |

### Key Insights

1. **Controls fail at execution, not design.** The control framework is well-designed; weaknesses are in human execution under pressure.
2. **Automation is the path to consistency.** Every control that could be automated has improved effectiveness.
3. **Evidence quality correlates with control type.** Automated = complete evidence; Manual = variable evidence.

### Regulatory Change Horizon

| Upcoming Regulation | Effective Date | Impact Assessment | Readiness |
|--------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| AMLR (EU AML Regulation) | 2027 | High - New CDD requirements | Planning |
| eIDAS 2.0 (Digital Identity) | 2026 | High - Opportunity for digital onboarding | Assessment |
| AI Act | 2025-2026 | Medium - Jumio AI documentation needed | Not started |

### Control Optimization Opportunities

| Control | Current State | Optimization | Benefit |
|---------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| CP-COB-015 Welcome Call | 33% manual completion | Multi-channel digital approach | 80%+ completion |
| CP-COB-013 Config Verification | Manual checklist | Automated system comparison | 100% coverage |
| CP-COB-007 PEP Screening | 40% false positives | Rule tuning | 20-30% workload reduction |

## 6. Strategic Priorities

### Priority 1: Close Critical Compliance Gaps

**Objective:** Eliminate the two high-risk compliance gaps within 30 days

**Risk Addressed:** GDPR inspection finding (DPIA), AML liability for partner channel (Third Party Reliance)

**Rationale:** Both gaps represent clear regulatory non-compliance that would be identified in any examination. The DPIA gap also blocks transformation initiatives. These are not optional improvements—they are compliance obligations.

**Actions Required:**

| Action | Owner | Regulation | Status |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| Commission DPIA for Client Onboarding | Data Protection Officer | GDPR Art. 35 | Planning |
| Develop Third Party Reliance framework | Compliance Officer | AMLD 5 Art. 26 | Planning |
| Conduct due diligence on existing partners | Compliance Officer | AMLD 5 | Not started |

**Success Criteria:** DPIA completed and filed; TPR agreements signed with all active partners

**Regulatory Consequence if Not Addressed:** DPC finding on DPIA; CBI finding on TPR; potential enforcement action

---

### Priority 2: Fix Ineffective Welcome Call Control

**Objective:** Achieve 80%+ client communication completion rate

**Risk Addressed:** Consumer detriment from inadequate disclosure; OAF-COB-001 audit finding

**Rationale:** The welcome call control is ineffective (2.2/5). This creates disclosure risk and has been flagged by Internal Audit. The control objective is valid—the mechanism is wrong. Modern business clients expect digital-first communication.

**Actions Required:**

| Action | Owner | Regulation | Status |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| Design multi-channel communication approach | Operations + Digital | Consumer Protection Code | In Progress |
| Implement in-app onboarding wizard | Digital Team | Consumer Protection Code | Planning |
| Add disclosure acknowledgment tracking | Digital Team | Consumer Credit Directive | Planning |

**Success Criteria:** 80%+ completion rate; documented acknowledgment of key terms

**Regulatory Consequence if Not Addressed:** Consumer complaints; Consumer Protection Code findings; continued audit finding

---

### Priority 3: Strengthen Manual Control Evidence

**Objective:** Achieve complete audit trail for all controls

**Risk Addressed:** Audit readiness; evidence gaps for manual controls

**Rationale:** Three audit trail requirements are rated "Partial"—all for manual controls. This creates risk during examination when auditors request evidence of control performance.

**Actions Required:**

| Action | Owner | Regulation | Status |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| Make configuration checklist a system gate | IT + Operations | Internal Policy | Not started |
| Implement call recording linkage to cases | IT | Internal Policy | Not started |
| Migrate quality review to QMS system | Operations | Internal Policy | In Progress |

**Success Criteria:** 100% of controls have complete, accessible audit evidence

**Regulatory Consequence if Not Addressed:** Auditor unable to verify control operation; qualified audit opinion

---

### Quick Wins (Immediate Risk Reduction)

| Quick Win | Effort | Risk Reduction | Owner | Target |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|--------|
| Complete DPIA | Low | High | DPO | 30 days |
| Document AML handover | Low | Medium | Compliance | 30 days |
| Sign TPR agreements with top 5 partners | Medium | High | Compliance | 45 days |

### Remediation Summary

| Category | Items | Investment Required | Risk Reduction |
|----------|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| Critical Gaps | 2 | €15-25K | High |
| Audit Findings | 3 | €50-75K | Medium |
| Control Improvements | 5 | €75-100K | Medium |
| **TOTAL** | 10 | €140-200K | Significant |

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Close DPIA and TPR gaps within 30 days—these are non-negotiable compliance obligations
2. **Short-term:** Redesign client communication to achieve 80%+ completion and close audit finding
3. **Long-term:** Increase control automation rate to 40%+ to improve consistency and reduce manual control risk

### Next Steps

| Step | Responsible | Deadline | Regulatory Driver |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Initiate DPIA with DPO | Process Owner | Week 1 | GDPR Art. 35 |
| Draft TPR framework | Compliance | Week 2 | AMLD 5 Art. 26 |
| Present communication redesign | Operations | Week 4 | OAF-COB-001 |
