## How to Read This Document

> This document captures the **client experience perspective (AS-IS)** of the Onboarding process. It maps the journey through client eyes, measuring effort and identifying friction.
>
> **Companion Documents:**
> - [Client Touchpoints Detail](./client-touchpoints-detail.md) - Full touchpoint analysis with CES contribution
> - [Friction Points Detail](./friction-points-detail.md) - Detailed friction analysis with enhancement ideas
> - [AS-IS Process Documentation](./as-is-process-documentation.md) - Operational process view
>
> **CES Interpretation:**
> - **Low CES (< 20)** - Excellent client experience, minimal effort
> - **Medium CES (20-40)** - Acceptable experience, improvement opportunities exist
> - **High CES (> 40)** - Poor experience, significant transformation required

## 1. Journey Overview

> **About this section:** What is this journey from the client's perspective? What outcome are they trying to achieve?

### 1.1 Journey Identification

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Journey Name** | Setting up my business banking |
| **Process ID** | ONB-001 |
| **Client Goal** | Get account set up as fast as possible |
| **Journey Trigger** | Starting a new business |
| **Success Outcome** | Receiving account details (client considers setup "done" at this point) |
| **Typical Duration** | TBD (Note: Bank sees 180-day journey; client sees it complete once they have account details) |

### 1.2 Client Persona

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Segment** | All segments (general analysis) |
| **Typical Profile** | Small SME companies, founder-led. Solo decision-makers who are time-poor and juggling everything themselves. |
| **Key Motivations** | Don't like hassle — want it simple, straightforward, no friction. Every extra step is a burden. |
| **Expected Experience** | Better service — expectations set by fintechs and modern digital experiences. Expect the bank to be better than what they've seen elsewhere. |

### 1.3 Journey Context

- **Client Type:** Mix of new and existing clients — some already familiar with the bank, others brand new
- **Time Pressure:** High urgency — they want to transact quickly. Every day without banking capability is a day they can't operate properly.
- **Emotional Stakes:** Critical business need — need the account working so they can start doing business
- **Alternatives:** Other banks, fintechs (clients have options and expect competitive experience)

> **Section Confidence:** HIGH | **Basis:** SME knowledge from direct client interaction

### 5.4 CES Baseline Statement

> **CES BASELINE FOR TO-BE COMPARISON**
>
> This AS-IS CES score (**TBD**) establishes the baseline for transformation.
> During TO-BE design, this score will be compared against the target state to measure
> improvement. Industry standard for transformation projects is **30-40% CES reduction**.
>
> After the Transformation Agent designs the TO-BE state, the Client Journey Analyst
> will recalculate CES in **Flow 2 (Target Validation)** to verify improvements.
