# Management Summary: Onboarding - Innovation Analysis

**Document Type:** Innovation Analysis Management Summary (Amazon 6-Pager Format)
**Process ID:** ONB-001
**Business Unit:** BizBanking
**Innovation Analyst:** Markus (COO)
**Date:** 2025-12-09

## 1. Introduction

### The Competitive Reality

JPMorgan Chase has deployed GenAI assistants to 140,000 employees and leads the industry with more AI researchers than the next 7 banks combined. ING has become the EU benchmark for business onboarding innovation. Neobanks like Qonto and Wise Business now offer 10-minute account opening while our BizBanking onboarding takes days. **38% of customers drop off midway through traditional bank onboarding** (Deloitte). We have identified 3 MUST HAVE innovations that can close this gap, but without immediate action, we risk continued market share erosion to digitally-native competitors.

### Background

Deutsche Bank's BizBanking onboarding process spans 180 days across 8 process steps, utilizing 7 systems for multi-channel engagement. Current activation rate stands at 78% against an 85% target - a 7% gap that translates directly to lost revenue. The existing Google chatbot pilot and dbLumina GenAI capabilities provide foundation infrastructure, while the IBM partnership offers automation expertise. This analysis identifies how to leverage these assets to match fintech experience expectations.

## 3. Tenets

### Core Principles

1. **Innovation Must Align with Business Strategy**
   Focus on digital transformation and cost cutting - our declared strategic themes. Innovation for innovation's sake is waste. Every recommendation serves these objectives.

2. **Learn from Leaders, Differentiate from Competitors**
   Study JPMorgan's AI deployment, ING's onboarding benchmark, fintech speed. But differentiation, not imitation, creates competitive advantage.

3. **Client-Centric Innovation**
   Every innovation must answer: "How does this improve the customer's 180-day journey?" Internal efficiency alone is insufficient justification.

4. **Proof of Concept Before Scale**
   The Google chatbot is a pilot for a reason. RPA needs phased rollout. Validate assumptions before scaling investment.

5. **Regulatory Compliance Constrains Innovation**
   DORA is active. eIDAS 2.0 is coming. KYC/AML requirements are non-negotiable. Every innovation must work within these boundaries.

6. **Feasibility Before Priority**
   All 10 innovations scored across 6 dimensions. No priority assigned without rigorous feasibility assessment.

### Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale | Impact on Innovation |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| DORA compliance | Digital operational resilience (Jan 2025) | All tech innovations must meet ICT requirements |
| Legacy system integration | 7 existing systems | RPA complexity, phased approach required |
| KYC/AML requirements | Regulatory obligation | AI-assisted KYC requires human approval layer |
| Resource capacity | Developer availability | Sequential not parallel implementation |

## 5. Lessons Learned

### What's Working in the Market

- **RPA delivers proven ROI:** Industry reports ~$52M annual KYC compliance savings, 5 days → 10 minutes onboarding reduction
- **GenAI has moved beyond experimentation:** JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank (dbLumina), and others now scaling production deployments
- **Personalization drives activation:** AI-personalized communications show 15-20% higher engagement rates
- **Chatbots reduce costs:** 20-40% call centre deflection is achievable with properly trained conversational AI
- **Progress visibility improves completion:** Customers who can see their journey status complete at higher rates

### What's Not Working / Overhyped

- **Blockchain for KYC:** Overhyped. Limited production success. EU Digital Wallet (eIDAS 2.0) will solve this problem better.
- **Fully autonomous AI onboarding:** Regulatory constraints (KYC/AML) require human-in-the-loop. AI assists, humans decide.
- **Big bang transformations:** Industry failures show phased, iterative approaches succeed more often.
- **Innovation without metrics:** "Innovation theater" where pilots never scale because success criteria weren't defined.

### Key Insights

1. **Foundation innovations enable others:** II-ONB-001 (Chatbot) and II-ONB-005 (RPA) are prerequisites for multiple downstream innovations. Prioritize these first.
2. **Quick wins build momentum:** Chatbot expansion and AI personalization can deliver value in 6 months, building credibility for larger investments.
3. **EU Digital Wallet is a timing play:** eIDAS 2.0 specs aren't finalized until 2026. First-mover advantage exists, but betting too early wastes resources.

### Failed Innovation Examples (Industry)

| Innovation | Why It Failed | Lesson for Us |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| Blockchain KYC consortiums | Governance complexity, limited adoption | Wait for regulatory solutions (eIDAS 2.0) |
| Chatbots without escalation | Customer frustration when stuck | Build human handoff from day 1 |
| RPA without change management | Staff resistance, workarounds | Invest in change management for II-ONB-005 |

### Successful Innovation Examples (Industry)

| Innovation | Why It Succeeded | Applicability to Us |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| JPMorgan GenAI assistant | Started internal, scaled after validation | Apply to II-ONB-002 (personalization) |
| ING digital onboarding | End-to-end redesign, not point solutions | Align with BizBanking Redesign project |
| Neobank speed | Mobile-first, minimal friction | Aspiration for self-service portal (II-ONB-008) |

### Feasibility Lessons

| Dimension | Insight | Implication |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Technical | Existing pilots (chatbot) and partnerships (IBM) reduce risk | Leverage existing assets |
| Regulatory | DORA + eIDAS 2.0 create both constraints and opportunities | Time innovations to regulatory calendar |
| Resource | 7+ FTE needed across MUST HAVEs | Secure resourcing before commitment |
| Risk | Legacy integration is #1 technical risk | Early technical assessment for RPA |
