    "purpose": "The Onboarding process serves to establish and maintain systematic communication with new BizBanking customers from their initial sign-in through the first 180 days of the banking relationship. The primary objectives are: (1) Activation - Ensure customers activate their accounts and understand available banking services through welcome communications, demo videos, and pre-approved offers. (2) Engagement - Maintain continuous touchpoints via multiple channels (SMS, email, phone, branch, social media) to build relationship depth and prevent early attrition. (3) Education - Guide customers through bank processes and available products through structured communication at key milestones.",
    "trigger": "The Onboarding process is triggered when a new BizBanking customer completes their initial Sign In to the banking platform. This is the Day 1 event that initiates the 180-day onboarding journey. The sign-in event indicates that account opening has been completed, customer credentials have been provisioned, and the customer is ready to begin their banking relationship.",
    "frequency": "The Onboarding process runs continuously - each new BizBanking customer sign-in initiates an individual 180-day onboarding journey. Multiple customer journeys run in parallel at any given time. The process follows a structured cadence: Activation (Day 1-2) with multiple simultaneous touchpoints, Early Engagement (Day 5-14) with 2-3 touchpoints, Mid-Journey (Day 30-60) with 3-4 touchpoints, Late Journey (Day 60-90) with 2 touchpoints, and Close-Out (Day 180) with final follow-up.",
    "volume": "Per Customer Journey: 10-15 touchpoints across 180 days, multiple channels engaged (SMS, email, phone, branch, social media), estimated 5-7 system interactions per customer. Operational volume metrics (new customer sign-ins per month, concurrent onboarding journeys, total communications sent) to be confirmed with SME input.",
