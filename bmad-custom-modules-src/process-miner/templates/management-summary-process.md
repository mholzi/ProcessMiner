AMAZON 6-PAGER WRITING GUIDANCE

This is a NARRATIVE document, not a report. It tells a story.
Executives will read this in silence for 20-30 minutes before discussion.

CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. Lead with WHY - First paragraph must hook the reader with business impact
2. Anchor in DATA - Every claim needs evidence, not opinions
3. BRUTAL HONESTY - Especially in Lessons Learned. No sugar-coating.
4. NARRATIVE FLOW - Problem → Context → Solution → Impact
5. CLEAR OWNERSHIP - Every action has a name and deadline
6. WRITE INTRODUCTION LAST - After you understand the full picture

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:
✗ Generic descriptions ("This process is designed to...")
✗ Passive voice ("It was decided that...")
✗ Vague metrics ("Significant improvement expected...")
✗ Missing baselines ("Baseline: Not established")
✗ Polite criticism ("Some areas could be improved...")
✗ Actions without owners ("The team should...")
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 1. Introduction

<!--
WRITE THIS SECTION LAST - after completing all other sections.

PURPOSE: Hook the executive in the first paragraph. Make them care.
LENGTH: ½–1 page maximum

STRUCTURE:
1. Opening Hook (2-3 sentences): State the business problem/opportunity with impact
2. Context (1 paragraph): What is this process and why does it matter?
3. Purpose Statement: What decision or action does this memo support?
4. Scope Table: Boundaries of the analysis

GOOD EXAMPLE:
"We are losing €2.3M annually because 22% of new customers never activate.
This memo analyzes the Onboarding process to identify root causes and
proposes three actions that will recover €1.8M within 12 months."

BAD EXAMPLE:
"The Onboarding process is a structured 180-day customer journey designed
to establish and maintain systematic communication with new customers."
-->

### The Problem

{{opening_hook_problem_statement}}

<!--
INSTRUCTION: State the core business problem in 2-3 sentences.
Include: What's broken? What's the cost? Why does it matter NOW?
Use specific numbers. Create urgency.
-->

### Background

{{background_context}}

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Brief context for readers unfamiliar with the process.
Keep it SHORT. Only what's needed to understand the problem.
-->

### Purpose of This Document

This management summary analyzes the current state of the **{{process_name}}** process and recommends {{number_of_priorities}} strategic actions to {{primary_outcome}}.

**Decision Required:** {{decision_or_action_requested}}

### Scope

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Process Category** | {{process_category}} |
| **Geographic Scope** | {{region}} |

## 2. Goals

<!--
PURPOSE: Define what success looks like with MEASURABLE targets
LENGTH: ½ page maximum

RULES:
- Every metric MUST have a baseline (if unknown, say "UNKNOWN - ACTION REQUIRED")
- Targets must be specific and time-bound
- If baseline is missing, that's a finding, not an excuse
- Use traffic light status: ✅ On track, ⚠️ At risk, ❌ Off track
-->

### What Success Looks Like

{{success_vision_statement}}

<!--
INSTRUCTION: One sentence describing the target state.
Example: "A customer who signs up is fully activated within 30 days
and remains engaged through their first year."
-->

### Primary Objectives

| Objective | Baseline | Current | Target | Gap | Status |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| {{objective_1}} | {{baseline_1}} | {{current_1}} | {{target_1}} | {{gap_1}} | {{status_1}} |
| {{objective_2}} | {{baseline_2}} | {{current_2}} | {{target_2}} | {{gap_2}} | {{status_2}} |

| {{objective_4}} | {{baseline_4}} | {{current_4}} | {{target_4}} | {{gap_4}} | {{status_4}} |

<!--
INSTRUCTION: If baseline is unknown, write "UNKNOWN ⚠️" not "Not established"
Unknown baselines are a problem to be fixed, not accepted.
-->

## 3. Tenets

<!--
PURPOSE: Guiding principles that constrain decisions. Non-negotiable.
LENGTH: ½ page maximum

TENETS ARE NOT:
- Tactics ("We will use agile methodology")
- Goals ("We will improve customer satisfaction")
- Obvious statements ("Quality is important")

TENETS ARE:
- Trade-off resolvers ("When speed conflicts with compliance, compliance wins")
- Decision filters ("Every control must trace to a regulation")
- Non-negotiables ("Segregation of duties cannot be compromised")
-->

### Guiding Principles

## 4. State of the Business

<!--
PURPOSE: Honest snapshot of where we are NOW
LENGTH: 1 page maximum

THIS IS NOT a process description. It's a diagnostic.
Answer: "If an executive walked the floor today, what would they see?"

STRUCTURE:
1. Executive Summary (3-4 sentences - the headline)
2. Key Metrics Table (the scorecard)
3. What's Working (be specific, with evidence)
4. What's NOT Working (be brutally honest)
5. Top 5 Critical Items (prioritized by impact)
-->

### Executive Summary

{{state_executive_summary}}

<!--
INSTRUCTION: 3-4 sentences maximum. The headline.
Example: "The process is structurally sound but operationally underperforming.
All four KPIs are below target. The root cause is lack of standardized
procedures - staff are improvising. We have compliance exposure."
-->

### Scorecard

| Metric | Value | Target | Status | Trend |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| {{metric_1}} | {{value_1}} | {{target_1}} | {{status_1}} | {{trend_1}} |
| {{metric_2}} | {{value_2}} | {{target_2}} | {{status_2}} | {{trend_2}} |
| {{metric_3}} | {{value_3}} | {{target_3}} | {{status_3}} | {{trend_3}} |
| {{metric_4}} | {{value_4}} | {{target_4}} | {{status_4}} | {{trend_4}} |

### What's Working

{{whats_working}}

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Be specific. Include evidence.
GOOD: "KYC screening is effective - 0.8% decline rate, zero false negatives in audit"
BAD: "The compliance controls are functioning well"
-->

### What's NOT Working

{{whats_not_working}}

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Be brutally honest. Name the problems clearly.
GOOD: "We have no Desktop Procedure. Staff are guessing. This is unacceptable."
BAD: "Documentation could be improved in some areas"
-->

### Top 5 Critical Items

| Rank | Issue | Impact | Evidence | Owner |
|------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | {{issue_1}} | {{impact_1}} | {{evidence_1}} | {{owner_1}} |
| 2 | {{issue_2}} | {{impact_2}} | {{evidence_2}} | {{owner_2}} |
| 3 | {{issue_3}} | {{impact_3}} | {{evidence_3}} | {{owner_3}} |
| 4 | {{issue_4}} | {{impact_4}} | {{evidence_4}} | {{owner_4}} |
| 5 | {{issue_5}} | {{impact_5}} | {{evidence_5}} | {{owner_5}} |

---

## 5. Lessons Learned

<!--
PURPOSE: Honest assessment of what we've learned. No sugar-coating.
LENGTH: ½–1 page maximum

THIS IS THE HARDEST SECTION TO WRITE WELL.

AMAZON PRINCIPLE: "Lessons Learned should make you uncomfortable"

RULES:
- If nothing makes you uncomfortable, you're not being honest enough
- Name failures specifically, not generically
- Include root causes, not just symptoms
- Show evidence for every claim
-->

### What We Got Right

{{lessons_got_right}}

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Specific successes with evidence.
GOOD: "Multi-channel strategy reduced drop-off by 15% vs single-channel baseline"
BAD: "The team worked hard and made good progress"
-->

### What We Got Wrong

{{lessons_got_wrong}}

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Be uncomfortable. Name failures.
GOOD: "We've operated for 18 months without a Desktop Procedure. This is a
failure of process governance. Staff have been improvising, and we've been
lucky there hasn't been a compliance incident or customer complaint."
BAD: "Documentation gaps exist that should be addressed"
-->

### Root Causes

| Problem | Root Cause | Evidence | Accountability |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|
| {{problem_1}} | {{root_cause_1}} | {{evidence_1}} | {{who_is_accountable_1}} |
| {{problem_2}} | {{root_cause_2}} | {{evidence_2}} | {{who_is_accountable_2}} |
| {{problem_3}} | {{root_cause_3}} | {{evidence_3}} | {{who_is_accountable_3}} |

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Root causes, not symptoms.
Symptom: "Activation rate is low"
Root cause: "Day 2-5 communications don't address customer hesitation points"
-->

### Key Insights

1. {{insight_1}}
2. {{insight_2}}
3. {{insight_3}}

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Actionable insights, not observations.
GOOD: "Process structure is sound; execution is the problem. Fix execution, not design."
BAD: "There are opportunities for improvement in several areas"
-->

---

## 6. Strategic Priorities

<!--
PURPOSE: What we must do. This is THE CORE of the document.
LENGTH: 2–3 pages

EVERY PRIORITY MUST HAVE:
1. Clear objective (what we're trying to achieve)
2. Compelling rationale (why this matters NOW)
3. Specific actions (with owners and dependencies)
4. Success criteria (how we'll know it worked)
5. Consequences of inaction (what happens if we DON'T do this)

PRIORITIES SHOULD CREATE URGENCY
Not: "This would be beneficial to address"
But: "If we don't fix this, [specific bad thing] will happen"
-->

### Priority 1: {{priority_1_title}}

**Objective:** {{priority_1_objective}}

**Why Now:** {{priority_1_urgency}}

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Create urgency. Why can't this wait?

BAD: "This has been on the backlog and should be addressed"
-->

**Actions:**

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Dependencies |

| 3 | {{action_1_3}} | {{owner_1_3}} | {{deadline_1_3}} | {{deps_1_3}} |

**Success Criteria:** {{priority_1_success_criteria}}

**If We Don't Do This:** {{priority_1_consequences}}

<!--
INSTRUCTION: Be specific about consequences.
GOOD: "Audit findings, potential regulatory action, continued revenue leakage of €X/month"
BAD: "Continued challenges in this area"
-->

---
